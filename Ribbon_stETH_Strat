//DONT WORRY ABOUT READING THESE, I'VE COMMMENTED THE CODE ABOVE FOR READERS, THE COMMENTS BELOW ARE PERSONAL NOTES AND A BIG FRAGMENTED
//NOTES TO MYSELF:

  //Process for depositing Ribbon:
            //DepositETH - uses IRibbon interface
            //Read `RibbonVault.shares` - your shares only appear after 10:00 AM UTC on Fridays. 
            //stake - staking those shares - IRibbon
            //This function takes the shares that the caller has inside the vault and 
                   //This function is called by the user:
                   //First it calls an approval for rstETH-Theta to be transferred
                   //Then it sends the rstETH-Theta to the Liquidity-Gauge using the ILiquidityGauge deposit function
                   //Finally, rstETH-Theta-Gauge is sent to the caller.
           

    //Process for withdrawing shit:
                   // Ribbon's contract for staking rstETH-Theta into rst-ETH-Theta-Gauge is an independent Vyper contract. You can stake off of the primary rstETH-Theta 
                   //contract but you cannot withdraw without interacting with the THETA-GAUGE contract.
                      //`Withdraw` called on rstETH-Theta-Gauge - IrstETH-Theta-Gauge
                                    //This function is called by the caller contract to interact with the rstETH-Theta-Gauge contract.
                                    //The caller contract is then sent rstETH-Theta
                                    //The rstETH-Theta-Gauge is then burned to 0x000
                                 // Unlike when initially depositing, the caller directly receives the rst-ETH - doesnt change the second layer
                  //Now our rstETH-Theta-Gauge is no longer tied up.
                  //move onto the two-step process of withdrawing from the main pool:
                       //Initializewithdraw - that is roughly the correct name
                            //Needs to happen before the next option is minted on Friday at 10:00 AM UTC. 
                       //CompleteWithdraw - roughly the correct name.
                             // Can occur after Friday at 10:00am UTC when your shares have been excluded from the new option.
